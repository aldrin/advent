//! # Advent of Code
//!
//! `advent` is a collection of my solutions to the [Advent of Code] puzzles posted in December each
//! year. The solutions are implemented as functions in the modules (e.g. `y2018` below) and can be
//! executed using `cargo test` with the appropriate scope selection
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ cargo test 2018::day1
//! running 2 tests
//! test y2018::day1::examples ... ok
//! test y2018::day1::solution ... ok
//! ```
