## Advent of Code

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/advent.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/advent)

[Advent of Code] are excellent samples for trying out Rust iterators and related features. This repository holds my 
solutions to the puzzles I've attempted so far. The library documentation (at [docs.rs/advent]) is a convenient way to 
browse the code.

```bash
$ cargo -q test 2017::day3  # to run a specific puzzle

running 2 tests
test y2017::day3::examples ... ok
test y2017::day3::solution ... ok

$ cargo test --release # to run all puzzles
```
